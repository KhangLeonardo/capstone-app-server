# Project: The "MyKids" app's App Server API

## Introduction

As thousands of parents are concerned about their child's early childhood education, a platform that bridges the gap between parents and teachers is necessary. Such a platform must be both efficient and user-friendly. In order to provide parents and teachers with a unified and user-friendly platform, the Parent App for Preschool (PAAS) is created in response to these obstacles in the collaboration between preschool parents and educators.
